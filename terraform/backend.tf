# Backend configuration for Terraform state management
# State file will be stored locally on your laptop

# Local backend - state stored in terraform.tfstate file
# The state file tracks all resources Terraform manages
# Backup file (terraform.tfstate.backup) is created automatically

# Note: For production environments, consider using remote backends like S3
# For this project, local backend is used as per requirements
